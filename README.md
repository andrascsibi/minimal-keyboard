This is an alternative keyboard layout inspired by the Colemak layout.

My problems with the Colemak layout was that 
- it is optimized for English (I write in Hungarian around 50% of the time)
- it changes up too many characters

I just wanted to move the 8 most frequent characters to the home row. Also, a little analysis of both languages showed that L is more frequent altogether than R so they can stay in place.
